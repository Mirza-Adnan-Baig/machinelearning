# Image Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms

* I implemented image segmentation using clustering algorithms in Python without using existing machine learning libraries.  

* This code performs image clustering using two different algorithms developed from scratch:
  * K-means.
  * DBSCAN.

## Working

* First, it loads an image and reduces its size. Then, it flattens the pixel data into a 2D array. Next, it applies K-means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to the pixel data, generating cluster labels. 

* After that, it calculates the average color for each cluster and creates a new image with those colors. 

* Finally, it displays the original image alongside the images generated by K-means and DBSCAN algorithms, showing how each algorithm clusters the colors in the image.
